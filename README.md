# Raspberry-Pi-Screw-Terminal-Shield

![picture]()

The raspberry pi pin header shield lets you use the raspberry pi pin headers without having to use dupont cables which can vary in quality. The shield lets you use different types of wires/cables and helps make connections to sensors, actuators and so on without the need to solder. The shield is designed to fit onto most raspberry pi boards out there.
The project is open-source hardware and designed with KiCad which makes it a lot easier for the user to modify.
